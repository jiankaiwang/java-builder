/*
This file was not auto generated by `gradle`.

In general, you can create an application by `gradle init`. However, the
command created several projects, or more like subprojects under a big project,
It brings us with difficulties sharing resources across these projects, 
especially for creating a JAR.

+ gradle             <- big project
  + app              <- sub-project, dependency on libs
    - build.gradle
  + libs             <- sub-project
    - build.gradle
  - build.gradle     <- this file
  - settings.gradle

This file was generated on the scope of big project, it was created for 
gathering the resources from different subprojects. After building, the build 
folder was also generated on the scope of big project.
